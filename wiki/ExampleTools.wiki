= print_two.py =

If you ever want to print something that is like a small booklet, but needs to be spiral bound, you either have to do some fancy rearranging, or just waste half your paper.

The print_two example program will, for example, make two side-by-side copies each page of of your PDF on a each output sheet.

But, every other page is flipped, so that you can print double-sided and the pages will line up properly and be pre-collated.
