The examples directory has a few scripts which use the library.

= print_booklet.py =

A printer with a fancy printer and/or a full-up copy of Acrobat can easily turn your small PDF into a little booklet (for example, print 4 letter-sized pages on a single 11" x 17").

But that assumes several things, including that the personnel know how to operate the hardware and software.  print_booklet.py lets you turn your PDF into a preformatted booklet, to give them fewer chances to mess it up.

= print_two.py =

If you ever want to print something that is like a small booklet, but needs to be spiral bound, you either have to do some fancy rearranging, or just waste half your paper.

The print_two example program will, for example, make two side-by-side copies each page of of your PDF on a each output sheet.

But, every other page is flipped, so that you can print double-sided and the pages will line up properly and be pre-collated.
