= Introduction =

The definitive [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf PDF manual] is 1310 pages long.  For the most part, pdfrw tries to be agnostic about the contents of PDF files, and support them as containers, but to do useful work, something a little higher-level is required.

= Missing features =

Even as a pure PDF container library, pdfrw comes up a bit short.
It does not currently support:

  * Most compression/decompression filters
  * PDF v. 1.5 compressed object streams
  * encryption

[http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/ pdftk] is a wonderful command-line tool that can convert your PDFs to remove encryption and compression.

= Higher-level capabilities =

Although pdftk is mostly a PDF file container library, it supports the following features:

  * PDF pages.  pdfrw knows enough to find the pages in PDF files you read in, and to write a set of pages back out to a new PDF file.
  * Form XObjects.  pdfrw can take any page or rectangle on a page, and convert it to a Form XObject, suitable for use inside another PDF file.
  * reportlab objects.  pdfrw can recursively create a set of reportlab objects from its internal object format.  This allows, for example, Form XObjects to be used inside reportlab.
