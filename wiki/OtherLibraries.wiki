#summary Other PDF manipulation libraries and tools

= Pure Python =

  * <a href="http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/">pypdf</a>

    pyPdf is, in some ways, very full-featured.
    It can do decompression and decryption and seems
    to know a lot about items inside at least some
    kinds of PDF files.  In comparison, pdfrw tries
    to know very little about the content of PDF
    files, and focuses on trying to have a more
    Pythonic API for mapping the PDF file container
    syntax to Python.

  * <a href="http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/pdftools/index.html">pdftools</a>

    pdftools feels large and I fell asleep trying to figure
    out how it all fit together, but many others have
    done useful things with it.

  * <a href="http://www.reportlab.com/docs/pagecatcher-ds.pdf">pagecatcher</a>

    My understanding is that pagecatcher would have done
    exactly what I wanted.  But I was on a zero budget,
    so I've never had the pleasure of experiencing
    pagecatcher.  I do, however, use and like reportlab
    (open source, from the people who make pagecatcher)
    so I'm sure pagecatcher is great, better documented
    and much more full-featured than the open source
    options.

= non-Python libraries =

  * pyPoppler apparently works quite well for displaying PDF files.

= Other tools =

  * pdftk is a wonderful command line tool for basic manipulation
