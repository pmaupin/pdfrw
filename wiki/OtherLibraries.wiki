#summary Other PDF manipulation libraries and tools

= Pure Python =

  * [http://www.reportlab.org/ reportlab]

    reportlab is must-have software if you want to programmatically
    generate arbitrary PDFs.

  * [http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/ pyPdf]

    pyPdf is, in some ways, very full-featured.
    It can do decompression and decryption and seems
    to know a lot about items inside at least some
    kinds of PDF files.  In comparison, pdfrw knows
    less about specific PDF file features (such as
    metadata), but focuses on trying to have a more
    Pythonic API for mapping the PDF file container
    syntax to Python, and (IMO) has a simpler and
    better PDF file parser.

  * [http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/pdftools/index.html pdftools]

    pdftools feels large and I fell asleep trying to figure
    out how it all fit together, but many others have
    done useful things with it.

  * [http://www.reportlab.com/docs/pagecatcher-ds.pdf pagecatcher]

    My understanding is that pagecatcher would have done
    exactly what I wanted when I built pdfrw.  But I was
    on a zero budget, so I've never had the pleasure of
    experiencing pagecatcher.  I do, however, use and
    like [http://www.reportlab.org/ reportlab]
    (open source, from the people who make pagecatcher)
    so I'm sure pagecatcher is great, better documented
    and much more full-featured than the open source
    options.

= non-pure-Python libraries =

  * [https://launchpad.net/poppler-python/ pyPoppler] can read PDF files.
  * [http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/ pycairo] can write PDF files.

= Other tools =

  * [http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/ pdftk] is a wonderful command line tool for basic PDF manipulation.  It complements pdfrw extremely well, supporting many operations such as decryption and decompression that pdfrw cannot do.
