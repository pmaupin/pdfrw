"""
Simple example of watermarking using form xobjects (pdfrw).

usage:   watermark.py [-u] my.pdf single_page.pdf

Creates watermark.my.pdf, with every page overlaid with
first page from single_page.pdf.  If -u is selected, watermark
will be placed underneath page (painted first).

NOTE 1: This program assumes that all pages (including the watermark
        page) are the same size.  For other possibilities, see
        the fancy_watermark.py example.

NOTE 2: At one point, this example was extremely complicated, with
        multiple options.  That only led to errors in implementation,
        so it has been re-simplified in order to show basic principles
        of the library operation and to match the other examples better.
