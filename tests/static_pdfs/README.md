PDF files to use when testing pdfrw

These were found in various places on the internet,
and are individually copyright by whoever owns them.

I place no copyright on the collection, and the code
is too trivial to copyright.

The goal is to keep them here for regression testing,
and never remove any of them unless one is the subject
of a copyright complaint, in which case I will remove
it from the collection.
